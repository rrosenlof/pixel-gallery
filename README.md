# About

This page was made for a Humanities 202 class at Brigham Young University, winter 2020.

I made the images using [another app I wrote](https://github.com/rrosenlof/pixels) in Python to programatically create pixelated images from inputs. Some minor editing was also done in Photoshop. This site was created with [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).
